Naturists, or people who practice a clothes-optional lifestyle, proved especially good as models (this comfort I had learned only after long practice), because we did not need clothes to make us comfortable.

  
To me, good modeling is a performing art that gains both from skill and  
from practice; but we need to get comfortable with it before we can  
begin. I joined the Society of Models for Art and Education, started to  
 model at New York and New Jersey schools, wrote a short guide book for  
models, and began teaching groups of models in various locations: at  
home, at naturist camps we attended and at schools in the New York  
area.
