Some models are asked to pose nude with other people. As in the  
case of photography sessions, the situation should be arranged ahead  
of time, and may be refused, even then. At the very least, models  
must be compatible with each other, and the qualifications they  
require for posing with someone else (what age or what sex a partner  
should be, for example), needs to be respected and accepted.

Posing nude with someone else is basically an intimate experience,  
if it is meaningful at all, and must have advance preparation on the  
part of willing models. Each pose requires mutual agreement on the  
part of the models; the most practical way of working this out is with  
models who are already thoroughly comfortable with each other.  
Intimate poses bv people who are thoroughly comfortable with each other  
are very deeply moving, to models as well as to artists, and can inspire  
wonderful works of art.
