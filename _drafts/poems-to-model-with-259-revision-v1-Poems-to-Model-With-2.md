 The third poem is one I especially like to use when posing along with a person I am particularly fond of. I have used this working with several different people in different situations, so the fondness is different each time. The poem is by E.E. Cummings.

  
Somewhere I have never traveled,  
 gladly beyond any imagining  
 your eyes have their silence.  
In your most frail gesture are things which enclose me,  
 or which I cannot touch because they are too near.  
Your slightest look easily will unclose me,  
 though I have closed myself as fingers,

You open always, petal by petal, my self  
As Spring opens, touching skillfully, mysteriously her first rose;  
Or if your wish be to close me, I and my life will shut,  
 very beautifully, suddenly  
As when the heart of the flower imagines  
The snow carefully everywhere descending.

I do not know what it is about you  
 that closes and opens  
 but there is something in me  
 understands;  
The voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses;  
Nobody, not even the rain  
Has such small hands.
