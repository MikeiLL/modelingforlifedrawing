You can prepare a financial cost-benefit analysis for each session:

<form id=calculator>
  <label>Hours Worked <input name=hrsworked type=number></label>
  <label>Hourly Fee <input name=hrlyfee type=number min="0.00" max="1000.00" step="0.01" ></label>
  <label>Expense Reimbursement <input name=reimbursement type=number min="0.00" max="1000.00" step="0.01" /></label>
  <label>Total Unpaid Time (In hours - include travel, other unpaid time) <input name=unpaidtime type=number min="0.00" max="1000.00" step="0.01" /></label>
  <label>Total Costs <input name=costs type=number min="0.00" max="1000.00" step="0.01" /></label>
</form>

By adding together all income (fee and expense reimbursement) for that
session, subtracting costs not reimbursed from the total income, then
dividing by the total number of hours involved, including travel and
waiting time. Thus, if you are paid $30.00 for a three-hour session,
spend $5.00 for transportation, and take an hour each way, your total
time is five hours, your income is $30.00 – $5.00 = $25.00, divided by
5, = $5.00 per hour.

If this ratio seems lower than your time is worth, and there are no
reasons of friendship, education, professional advancement, curiosity,
and such that make you want to repeat work with people, discuss the
possibility of raising your fee or getting transportation
reimbursement. If this doesn’t work out, look for appointments
somewhere else.
