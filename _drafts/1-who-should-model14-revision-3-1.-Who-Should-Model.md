Modeling is a valuable activity for people who have, or who want,  
a career in any performing art. It is helpful for development of  
self-image, and correction of minor physical and emotional  
imbalances. It is a good way of making friends and of getting  
involved with groups of people who are interested in artistic  
happenings. Above all, it is itself a performing art, worthy of  
respect’as such. People who can recognize this, and have the ability  
to carry it out, make good models.

A. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sizes and Shapes</span>

People are not “ideal” in size and shape. Enormous varieties are  
possible; people anywhere in the whole range of that variety can  
model, and can be particularly desirable for particular pictures.  
People working to improve imperfect sizes and shapes are likely to  
project themselves better than people do who are satisfied with these  
imperfections.

B. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Age, Health, and Handicaps</span>

People can begin modeling as early as they get an interest in it,  
and keep on until they lose that interest, no matter how old they  
are. Length of modeling sessions as well as length and style of  
poses must be modified in accordance with age and health  
reguirements. Physical disabilities can offer valuable insights to  
artists (and their acceptance can offer valuable insights to  
models). People with emotional disabilities can provide intense  
experience to artists, if – as sometimes happens – the modeling work  
is valuable to the models. People with mental retardation often  
offer magnificent examples of body freedom: examples badly needed by  
all our society, not just by artists.

> 1\) People under twelve should very seldom model more than one hour at a time.
> 
> 2\) People under 16 should probably be accompanied by adult relatives or friends for modeling sessions.

> 3\) People under 18 (legal age) should not sign model releases  
> for photographs without having an adult sign with them,  
> taking responsibility for the use of the photographs.

C. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Race and Ethnic Background</span>

Modeling enhances the values of racial and ethnic  
characteristics, making them clearer and more valuable for people  
open to understand them.

D. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Sex and Sexual Preference</span>

Sexual characteristics are quite obvious in nude modeling; sexual  
preferences are as clear, or as well hidden, through posing as they  
are through other activities.

E. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Experience of Abuse</span>

People who have experienced physical, emotional, or sexual abuse  
sometimes feel drawn to modeling as an occupation because of a bitter  
self image, and a feeling that they – as survivors of abuse – will be  
able to withstand the further feeling of abuse that modeling naked is  
likely to provide for them. The anti-personal history of modeling in  
many institutions is a valid basis for this expectation, but where it  
works out as expected, the experience is harmful to all concerned.  
On the other hand, where models find themselves surrounded entirely,  
naked as jaybirds, by the love and reverence of caring artists – and  
see the lovely (or heartfelt, or funny, or hard-fought) work that is  
drawn from them, the experience is deeply healing. While the past  
abuse may never be mentioned, and never even be recognized, some  
models find life-long friends: who love and care for them in their  
wholeness; by modeling for them.

F. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Woman or Man</span>

> 1\) Women models are requested more often than men.
> 
> 2\) Fewer men than women model.
> 
> 3\) Women are asked to return for “repeat performances” more  
> often than men are: this may be, in part, because some  
> types of discrimination against women have given women  
> greater necessity, and greater ability, to present themselves.  
> Men sometimes seem to feel that “being there” is enough – and  
> it’s not. Modeling is a performing art.

EXTRA: Two Stumbling Blocks to Modeling

A. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Getting Undressed</span>

Many potential models feel more awkward about getting naked than  
about being naked. A bathroom, which may be used for changing, must  
be available at any studio; some studios have changing areas. Bring  
your robe and a pocket mirror with you into the changing room, look  
at yourself all over in a mirror after you get undressed, use a comb  
to make last arrangements on your hair, put your robe around you  
(without tying it), ask if people are ready for you; and make your  
entrance. Wait until you have full attention; then drop your robe.  
This is easier said than done, of course – but it is very effective  
indeed, and its effectiveness soon makes it much easier. Wear  
clothes that “take off” easily; getting undressed in the company of  
artists you are posing with can soon be a valuable part of  
preparation for them, as well as for you, where the setting is  
right. If a session goes splendidly, getting dressed after it tends  
to be a bit sad, for everyone in the room.

B. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">What an Artist Might Draw  
</span>  
Anything visible; some things, sometimes, that aren’t visible.  
Many artists ignore, or diminish, body hair and genital areas. Where  
an artist begins on a work can be an especially disconcerting situation.   
Some begin at the head, some at the feet, some at the most prominent area, some where weight distribution is heaviest, some at the genitals: the midpoint of the body. Any of these approaches is fine.
