Dear User,  
Here is the beginning of a [new book](http://www.modelingforlifedrawing.com/community/content/blogsection/6/110/ "Perspectives on Figure Modeling ") “[Perspectives on Figure Modeling](http://www.modelingforlifedrawing.com/community/content/blogsection/6/110/ "Perspectives on Figure Modeling"),” which I started writing 30 years ago. I’ll plan to post other chapters later. Please send me your suggestions and comments.  
Hugh Kilmer
