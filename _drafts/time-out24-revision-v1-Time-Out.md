Sections ten through eighteen have been presented pretty grimly and very negatively. In some sense, their main message is: “When you find a problem, follow your own good judgment, instead of these suggestions or any others”. Work with photographers can be exciting and productive; posing with other people, especially when those people are dear to you, can be tremendously inspiring both to you and to artists who work with you. As in other areas of life, adventurous decisions often turn out most satisfying. The following sections of this pamphlet carry on, following the spirit of adventure, to make modeling the satisfying profession that it must be to fulfill its purpose: its role in art.
