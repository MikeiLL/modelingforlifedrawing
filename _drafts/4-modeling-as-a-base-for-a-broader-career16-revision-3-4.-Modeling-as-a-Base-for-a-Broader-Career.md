Most people who model do not consider modeling their primary  
career, but model to increase their income while they are trying to  
develop careers in other fields. Good modeling itself, however, is a  
performing art, and deserves to be respected as such, by models as  
well as by everyone else. A quick illustration: an actor who models  
well learns to act from the body out instead of from the costume out.

Stress aspects of modeling which most apply to other things that  
interest you; performance, athletics, design, health, personal  
relations, fashion, or whatever. These stresses will help your  
modeling itself, as well as other things you do.
