It is usually wise to arrange an interview, at least by phone,  
when you are preparing to work with an individual or a group. This  
will initiate personal contact, and provide time for negotiating  
details regarding a session. If the interview is direct, be sure to  
bring your resume and portfolio, once you have them prepared. Make  
sure that you become familiar with the scope of your particular  
contract; make sure that your own rights are covered in it.

Even in a phone interview, be sure that you make certain requirements of your own clear, and that some particular requirements  
made by your employer are also clear. Here are some examples:

> A) What is the hourly rate of pay, and when and how will that  
> pay be provided (cash, check, once a month, at the session,  
> and such like).
> 
> B) Is modeling to be totally nude, or may you be required to  
> wear a posing strap (male G-string) or a leotard? If you  
> distinctly prefer to pose nude, it is helpful – and often  
> persuasive – to say so in advance.
> 
> C) Ask whether contracts are made session by session or on a
> 
> longer-term basis (e.g. by the month, or several sessions in  
> a day). This will allow for better planning, and better  
> decisions as to whether a contract is worth your time.
> 
> D). Ask whether you should provide a replacement in case of  
> emergency, or whether they would prefer to provide their  
> own replacements. If they agree to let you provide your  
> own replacement, ask if they prefer a replacement of your  
> own sex, or whether the choice is completely up to you.
> 
> E) Bring your portfolio; do not offer a “nude demonstration”.  
> Such demonstrations should be explained if they are  
> requested, especially if you have your portfolio. Make up  
> your own mind as to the appropriateness of a request.

Though it may seem surprising, a phone interview is usually  
enough for a model and an artist to “size each other up”. If it is,  
still try to arrive early at your first session (by pre-arrangement),  
and bring your portfolio, for purposes of discussion.
