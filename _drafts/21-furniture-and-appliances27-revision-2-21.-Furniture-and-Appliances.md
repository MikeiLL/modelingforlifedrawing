> A) If the room is at all chilly, you ought to have a heater; afan may be appropriate in hot weather. If you can’t get warm enough, put on a few clothes for posing: things will change.

B) There should be a wide, sturdy model stand, with a soft rug  
on it. This brings the visual and mechanical center (the  
pubic area) of a standing model more or less level with the  
eyes of a seated artist, and allows comfortable reclining  
poses.

C) There should be a sturdy chair for you to sit on or rest  
against.

D) There should be enough light from outdoors or indoors so that  
the artist can see the model clearly; that light should not  
shine in anyone’s eyes.

E) There should be an easily visible clock, and/or a wind-up  
timer, so you can easily measure length of poses.
