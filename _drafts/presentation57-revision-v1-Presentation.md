Very often I have heard people say that to model, all you need to do is take off your clothes and be there. I think that modeling especially involves self-presentation.   
  
We need to address ourselves to people, not just be available for them  
to take. That is why the better we can know the people we work with,  
the better we can model for them. In the human context, work is always  
 more with than it is for. I think it is important to keep that in  
mind, from conceiving a baby to burying the dead—and beyond. If I keep  
my personal relationships in mind, it will be hard not to be  
interesting. If I ignore my own selfhood or the selfhood of people I am  
 working with, the contact is gone. “Who am I” and “who are you” are  
two questions that always need more answer.
