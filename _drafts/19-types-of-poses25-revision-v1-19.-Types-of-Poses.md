A) “Stretched” poses: usually short, (30 seconds to 2 minutes)  
take unusual shapes, usually feel stretched; used by artists  
for studies in foreshortening, action, and “character”.  
These serve well as “warm ups” both for models and for  
artists, and can offer excitement and variety not possible  
in longer poses.

B) Moving poses: continuous slow-motion poses from one position  
to another: used by artists for studies in shape-changing,  
and for understanding the natural movements of a particular  
person. Every still pose is, after all, a stop-action piece  
of a movement. Models can make these poses very interesting  
indeed.

C) Idealized poses: the kind of poses we expect to find in  
ancient Greek statues or in Renaissance paintings.

D) Character poses: these poses express moods and emotions.

E) Sport and fashion poses: shapes patterned after photographs  
and especially drawings you see in magazine and newspaper  
ads. I group these together because the object in each is  
“attraction.”

F) Natural pose: a pose you seem comfortable in. It works best  
if you are comfortable. A “jeans and a tee shirt” type of  
pose. These are especially appropriate for poses lasting  
fifteen minutes or longer.
