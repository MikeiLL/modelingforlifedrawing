 Maybe the only impossibility that is real is repetition. The only reality that is not new is newness. At the same time, “novelty” is not new, because doing something to-be-new is “old hat.”  
  
Being myself is the commonest way of being, but it’s also the only way  
in which I can be new. I find modeling a special “how” for all of this  
at once. Drawing people nude can have this newness also, if I take care  
 to keep myself working at it in that way. As an artist, and as a  
model, “making new” is my work.
