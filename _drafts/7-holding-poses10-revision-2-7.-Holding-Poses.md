A) When you take a long pose, take time to settle into it.  
First take a pose, one you can be comfortable with. If a  
pose you take turns out to be uncomfortable, change position.

B) In long poses, try to balance weight evenly, and be sure to  
use padding (folded cloth or pillow) at pressure points such  
as knees and elbows.

C) Concentrate attention on something of interest that isnâ€™t  
moving much: one of the artists, or something outside a  
window, for example.

D) Have an artist mark the places where your body rests on a  
surface, with chalk or charcoal, if you will be resuming a  
pose after a break; also mark positions of furniture you  
are using.

E) Pay attention to the feel of a pose, as well as to its shape.

F) Practise holding poses in front of a mirror, to see which  
ones you find particularly expressive.

G) Work out time limits on your own poses. Usually, about  
twenty minutes is a maximum for a single pose before it  
becomes rigid; then you need a break: for your own sake,  
for the sake of the artists, and for the sake of the pose.  
Different people, at different times, may find a longer pose  
appropriate. This is especially true in private sessions.
