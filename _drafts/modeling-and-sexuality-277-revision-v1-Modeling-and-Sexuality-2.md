When I first started modeling, I did it in  
 answer to a dare from models and artists in my Hoboken (NJ) drawing  
group that I would find it too embarrassing. I shared this worry, but I  
 also recognized, with others in the group, that it didn’t make sense  
for me to expect other people to do something that—because of  
embarrassment—I wasn’t willing to do myself. As soon as I opened myself  
 to public nudity, I found that the sexual arousal I had worried about  
was neither as intense nor as frequent as I had feared. I have once  
been invited by a married couple to make pictures of their lovemaking.   
This was a most holy and most beautiful thing to do. Models should work  
to be symbols and ideals, as well as examples of what we want to be, and  
 what we wish we were, as well as of what we are.
