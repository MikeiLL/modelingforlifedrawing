Getting undressed for modeling is very different from getting  
undressed for taking a bath or for going to bed. “Costumes” reveal,  
accent, and conceal; the modeling costume – nakedness – is designed  
primarily for revelation. Decorations which contribute to expression  
of the self “at the moment” make nakedness especially effective in  
its expressiveness. Here is a “pot pourri” of examples.

> A) Glasses help people communicate, when they are needed.  
> Communication often suffers when glasses are removed.
> 
> B) Foreskins are a natural part of a person. If they have not  
> been removed, they belong; if they have been removed – “Vive  
> la difference!”
> 
> C) Watches, rings, and other jewelry: some people “feel naked  
> without them”, and therefore won’t be truly naked unless  
> they have them on. These decorations also serve as nice  
> things to use for variety in different poses.
> 
> D) Hairstyles are very easy to change: a comb will change them  
> and offer surprising variety to poses. Pubic hair and other  
> body hair, like hair on the head, deserves attention, with  
> occasional changes in style during sessions. Hair can be  
> shaved or trimmed on occasion: this both changes your  
> appearance, and shows your recognition that each part of you, and every aspect, deserves artistic attention.
> 
> E) Women should wear tampons at modeling sessions during  
> menstrual periods, if they are comfortable with them, and  
> if menstrual flow is not too heavy. When menstrual flow  
> is heavy, models should get substitutes. If you are  
> wearing a tampon, don’t try to plan your poses so as to hide  
> its string. That attempt is inhibiting, confining, and  
> unnecessary. The string, under the circumstances, is a  
> decoration.
> 
> F) When you tan (and people of any race darken their color in  
> the sun), do your best to make sure that the tan is “all  
> over” by sunbathing at a clothes-optional beach or at a  
> health-spa which allows for all-over tanning. Untanned  
> areas offer visual distortion.
> 
> G) Be careful to wear non-restrictive clothing before going to  
> a modeling session; otherwise there will be marks at waist,  
> wrist, neck, or ankles, which last a surprisingly long time.  
> These can be interruptive. Women will be well-advised not  
> to wear brassieres before a session. An example: if you  
> wear a wristwatch, take it off, as you read this. See how  
> long it takes for the lines on your wrist to go away.
