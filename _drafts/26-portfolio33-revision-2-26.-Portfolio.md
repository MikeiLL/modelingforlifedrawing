After you have started modeling, ask artists, photographers, and  
students whose work you particularly like to let you keep one or two  
of the studies they make. Put these studies together in a large  
portfolio, and bring them with you to modeling interviews. A couple  
of professional photographs should also be included, even if you do  
not model for photographs. Credit the artists. Many artists will be  
pleased to have you include their work in your portfolio. You will  
almost never find it useful to show the portfolio, but it will give  
you an idea of your own progress, and will be handy in case you find  
that you do have a chance to negotiate a long-term contract, or one  
that offers a high rate of pay.
