One of the things I have felt since I first began drawing people, and then modeling for them, is that I do best when I am fond of the people I am working with. I want to be able to admire them, look up to them, and find them marvelous, so that my work with them can be my best. Only my best will be good enough for them: good enough for them to be their best for me. I must not be less than my best, because my best is what they deserve. I just realized today that, both as an artist and as a model, this is how I have approached making pictures of people since my first “nude” of Odysseus in third grade.
