A) Prepare a resume slanted toward modeling assignments. This  
resume should stress your education and experience in  
performing and in people-related activities. It should  
stress skills (ballroom dancing, writing, counseling),  
rather than titles (dorm-leader, yearbook editor, drag-  
racer), and should end with three personal references who  
know you are interested in modeling. If possible, at least  
one of these people should be an artist with whom you have  
worked as a model. If you have worked with well-known  
artists, be sure to list them, even if not as references;

list types of posing you have done (painting, sculpture,  
photography, anatomy), as well as places which have hired  
you.

B) Get a business card prepared, and carry several with you  
wherever you go. You should send two or three with each  
resume; hand out two or three at each interview; tape or glue  
an envelope of business cards on the inside cover of your  
portfolio, hand a few cards out at your first session with  
an artist or a group, if the people seem worth your while.  
The card will be especially effective if it is typeset on  
light-colored (not white) stock, with a graphic logo. The  
color and logo should be different from the color and logo on  
other cards you may distribute, so you can identify your  
modeling card easily. Place on the card your name, the  
title “artist’s model”, and a phone number where you can  
be contacted, as a model, without embarrassment. Do not  
include your address, but leave room so you can write that on  
later, for people who may have a good reason to need it.
