To safeguard their privacy, models are often addressed by first  
name only. Models can follow the same system in addressing artists  
and group leaders (e.g. instructors). To increase recognition,  
interest, and respect, models can introduce themselves by full name  
at some point in the session, and offer a little background  
information on themselves. This points out to other people that they  
respect themselves as members of their profession. It is good to  
overcome tendencies to hide personal identity, since fear of  
discovery will inhibit self-expression, and actual discovery of a  
hidden identity may cause embarrassment.
