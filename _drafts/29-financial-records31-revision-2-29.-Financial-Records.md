For two reasons, it is good to keep track of income and expenses  
related to modeling assignments.

> A) To make sure that records are straight for tax purposes.
> 
> B) To make sure that your modeling assignments produce more  
> for you than they cost. Income is simply what you get paid  
> per session (including transportation money, if that is part  
> of the agreement) . Expenses should include phone bills,  
> transportation expenses, expenses for advertising and publicity  
> publicity (printing business cards and resumes, mailing  
> letters and resumes, putting together your portfolio, agency  
> fees and association memberships ) . A second type of expense  
> which can’t be measured in a “reportable” way is expense of  
> time. Time spent in keeping a short appointment at a place  
> some distance away might be better spent keeping a longer  
> appointment closer to home, unless the more distant  
> appointment offers greater rewards in ways that are not  
> financial. See Appendix C for a financial records form.
