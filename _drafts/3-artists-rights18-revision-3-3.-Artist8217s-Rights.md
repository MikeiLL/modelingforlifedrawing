3\. What Artists Should Consider Their Rights at Drawing Sessions

A) Model will provide at least 24-hour notice, and suggest an  
alternate, if unable to take part in a session.

B) Model provides full attention to best possible modeling.

C) Artistâ€™s work is private, and need not be shared (of course,  
sharing can be very helpful indeed).

D) Model will fulfill any reasonable contract agreed to before  
a session or set of sessions has begun.

E) Model will arrive on time, and will not leave early:  
exceptions require notice.
