During drawing sessions, a model may experience sexual  
stirrings. The more intense a session is, the more likely it is that  
they will occur, as part of the overall intensification of the  
experience. They occur for artists, also, for the same reason.  
These stirrings are not usually very noticeable, and are most likely  
to be taken in stride by people who do notice them. Partial, and  
even full, erection of primary sexual organs (genitals) and of  
secondary sexual organs (most noticeably nipples, both male and  
female) can be caused by all sorts of factors other then sexual urges  
– and sexual urges are as natural, and as respectable, as anything  
else that causes bodily changes. Erections on men are seen unjustly  
but understandably, as threatening (because of cultural  
conditioning). This conditioning should be unlearned, and models can  
help with the unlearning. A good joke from a moderator, the model,  
or an artist – even a joke about the erection – can be an especially  
good way to help it subside. A sarcastic joke, on the other hand  
offers injury to a self-consciousness already made tender by the  
erection. In itself, an erection should be recognized as a  
compliment to members of the drawing group.

Some models feel that masturbation to ejaculation can prevent the  
occurence of erections during a drawing session that takes place  
shortly after the ejaculation. This approach, first, is likely to be  
futile, unless the model is awfully adept at self-suggestion.  
Second, it is deceptive even if it does work. It contradicts the  
revelation of self which, at least symbolically, is the essence of  
modeling as an art. Third it is unnecessary, since someone’s sexual  
organs are just as appropriate for art when erect as when flaccid.

Men are required to wear G-strings covering their genitals in  
some modeling situations, because cultural conditioning places the  
possibility of penile erections in an aura of fear. Some models feel  
they should refuse to pose in places where G-strings are required;  
others find that mutual aquaintance can free them, after a short  
while, from obeying the restriction. In itself a G-string does  
interfere and should not be required.

This section has been lengthy because the issue of sexual arousal  
offers intense worry to some artists and to many models (or potential  
models). As a practical problem, it is almost non-existent.
