Many people are concerned about modeling and sexual expression. For  
many years I worried about this, even after I started modeling, and I  
still recognize it, in myself and in others, as a disturbing event.   
Where sexual interest becomes evident in a modeling situation, it can be  
 difficult to temper so that it does not interrupt the artistic  
environment. In every culture since humanity began, our two chief  
interests in other individuals has been loving them or fighting them:   
loving them to the point of conception, and fighting them to the point  
of death. Not surprisingly, our best art, music and literature has  
embodied, nourished and celebrated these realities in our own individual  
 lives and in the history of our world. We may find it surprising to  
see a scroll of two Shinto warriors, each with an erection higher than  
his head, or to see a statue of the Hindu goddess Kali with her baby  
sitting in her open womb to bless us with a lotus flower; but this is  
the way that artists in different cultures have found to summarize their  
 understanding of the lives we really lead. They belong in our  
consciousness, conscience, and memory as a part of what we are.
