 When I model, I like to put as much of me as I can into the artist-model relationship – so I like to put talking and/or singing as part of the mix.  
  
While this may not be appropriate in a studio situation, it can be  
useful, with the instructor’s permission, in a classroom. I like to  
use, especially, one or more of three short poems if I can find a way to  
 fit them. All three of these poems work especially well for models who  
 are opening themselves to artists, because all three are joyful  
prayers.  
First and shortest is a poem my grandfather, Joyce Kilmer it is called  
“Easter”.

The air is like a butterfly  
 with pale, blue wings;  
The happy earth looks at the sky,  
 and sings.

The second is a sonnet by Gerard Manley Hopkins.

God’s Grandeur

The world is charged with the grandeur of God  
It will flame out, like shining from shook foil,  
It gather’s to a greatness like the ooze of oil  
Crushed. Why do men then now not wreck his rod?  
Generations have trod, have trod, have trod;  
And all is seared with trade; bleared, smeared with toil;  
And wears man’s smudge and shares man’s smell: The soil  
Is bare now, nor can foot feel, being shod.

And for all this, nature is never spent;  
There lives the dearest freshness deep down things;  
And though the last light off the black west went,  
Oh, morning, at the brown brink eastward, springs –  
Because the Holy Ghost over the bent   
World broods with warm breast and with ah! bright wings.

Gerard Manley Hopkins, 1877

Other Hopkins poems are wonderful for this too.
