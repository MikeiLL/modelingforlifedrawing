Artists are more likely to call on a model when they know you can
be reached, and are sure to turn up yourself, or arrange for a
substitute, if you arenâ€™t available. Get in touch with other models;
make sure that one or more will be willing to trade off assignments
with you. An artist or workshop may be able to help you develop such
a group, or find one that is already in existence near you. Make sure
that one person within your association will be able to take
assignments and distribute them (that person should be paid), or share
the cost of an answering service. Once you arc part of an association
of this sort, list it on your resume.

Model associations of this sort already exist in many areas. If
one exists, it is usually good to join it, rather than to start a new
one.
