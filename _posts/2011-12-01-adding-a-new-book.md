Dear User,  
Here is the beginning of a new book “[Perspectives on Figure Modeling](http://modelingforlifedrawing.com/documents/category/perspectives-on-figure-modeling/ "Perspectives on Figure Modeling"),” which I started writing 30 years ago. I’ll plan to post other chapters later. Please send me your suggestions and comments.
