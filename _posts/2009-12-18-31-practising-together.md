Modeling is a performing art; usually it is a lonely one. As with  
acting, singing, and dancing, however, it can he improved by group  
attention. Even solo performers work with teachers, do recitals  
together, and watch each other work. This has not been a practise  
with models before, chiefly – I think – because we have not properly  
recognized that it could he valuable. Please email me if you are  
interested, at <info@modelingforlifedrawing.com> , or print out the  
workshop information form linked here, and mail it to me.
