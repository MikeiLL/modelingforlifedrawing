Do not sign a model release:

> A) If the photographer and a witness do not sign also.
> 
> B) If you are not provided with a copy of the signed release.
> 
> C) If you are not convinced that the photographer’s work will  
> represent you in a way that you approve. This matter  
> includes the photographer’s choice of potential publishers.
> 
> D) If a model release provided by the photographer seems to  
> provide protection only for the photographer, not for you.  
> In this situation, offer your own version of a release as  
> an alternative. The sample offered in Appendix D may help.
