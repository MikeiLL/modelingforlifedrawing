Models often leave the profession after very few months or  
years. As ordinarily practiced, the profession is thankless and  
lonely. It is usually better to stop before you get bored and angry  
– and then to start again later – than it is to go on until you  
simply can’t stand it any longer. Burned-out models, like any other  
professionals suffering from burnout, can be harmful, rather than  
helpful, to others as well as to themselves. Burnout can often be  
remedied, and even prevented; but while it is there it is a real  
problem, and needs to be dealt with.

One way to avoid burnout is to develop friendships with artists  
or group moderators you work with regularly. Doing this helps  
prevent a feeling of drudgery in your work.

If you feel burnout coming on, take a break for a week or two –  
even if this offers financial difficulty. You are likely to have a  
fresh perspective when you get back to modeling – if you haven’t  
waited too long before you took your break.

Find a new setting for modeling, and new artists to work with.
