Fashion modeling differs from modeling for life-drawing for  
several reasons:

A) The fashion-modeling job is better paid.

B) The career of a fashion model is usually short, because  
magazines donâ€™t want to use faces and figures that have  
become familiar.

C) Clothes, make up, and hair serve as focus for fashion work.

D) Very few people are accepted as fashion models. Art  
modeling is not likely to provide a successful entree, but  
gives practice.

E) Fashion modeling is for advertising, and is more eligible for  
misuse than art modeling is, though both can be misused, and  
both can be appropriate.
