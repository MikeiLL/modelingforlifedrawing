> A) A large towel. This can serve many purposes: it can be a  
> comfortable rug, a comfortable seat cover, a drape, a  
> blanket, a furniture protector, a hair cover, and so on.
> 
> B) A model-release form (several, if several photographers may  
> be present).
> 
> C) A piece of chalk and a piece of charcoal, for marking poses.
> 
> D) A male G-string (simple, not “jokey”), or a plain leotard,  
> (or body-suit) in case complete nudity is forbidden for some  
> reason – or you find nudity inappropriate for the people you  
> are working with. Male G-strings can be purchased at  
> specialty lingerie shops in most metropolitan areas; leotards  
> are available at dance supply shops.
> 
> E) A wind-up timer, so you can time poses yourself.
> 
> F) Teabags, instant coffee, or something to warm you up  
> during breaks, in case nothing of the sort is made available.
> 
> G) A couple of “interesting things” to pose with: see 22b.
> 
> H) A pocket mirror: to check on your looks, and to use as a  
> “prop”.
