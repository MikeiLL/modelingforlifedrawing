There are three basic types of modeling sessions with a group.
The first is a two-hour or under session. This kind is non-tiring,
but likely to be unsatisfying both for model and for artist, because
neither can get “all the way into it.” For models, it is likely not
to provide enough income to make it worthwhile, unless it is very
close to home, and does not interrupt other activities. The
three-hour session is likely to be exhausting, but far more
satisfying to everyone in every way. A marathon session – lasting
for at least eight hours – can be terrific as an occasional
experience.
