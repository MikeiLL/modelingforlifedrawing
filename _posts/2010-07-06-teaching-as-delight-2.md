 I have worked with many subjects, and with many students, from nursery school into graduate school. As I have studied “teaching people,” I have learned that the “who-being-taught” is always more important than the “what” that is being taught to them; and that the one result to look for, in all of us, at every point in the process, is delight.   
  
Even in heaven, I don’t know how I would be eternally happy unless I  
were eternally growing. To me, perhaps, this is the theological insight  
 of the French theologian Theilhard de Chardin: A “stopped God” doesn’t  
 make sense. Endless “beingness” must be infinite growth. Is this  
endless growth what all we creatures are made to share, each in our  
individual place, and each in our individual way?
