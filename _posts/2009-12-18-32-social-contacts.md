Modeling brings a person, naked, into public contact with other  
people, all of whom are clothed. The discrepancy between clothedness  
and nakedness sets up an artificial separation which tends to be  
continually jarring. Some models counteract the jarring effect of  
this discrepancy by developing social contacts at nudist resorts or at  
clothes-optional recreation sites (usually pools and beaches) where  
nakedness is shared instead of isolated, social nudity is far more  
different from nudity for modeling than people often recognize. It is  
a useful adjunct, rather than a substitute for, professional  
preparation. For more information contact [The Naturist Society](http://www.naturistsociety.com "Naturist Society") (P.O.  
Box 132, Oshkosh, Wisconsin, 54902), or email me for  
names of local groups or personal contacts in your area.
