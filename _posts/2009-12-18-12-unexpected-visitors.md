A) Friends and Relations

Sometimes people you know from your role in life as a stock  
broker (or something) turn up at a session where you are modeling.  
This may embarrass you, or your contact, or both. There are several  
possible responses. Here are several suggestions – one of them,  
where you are “up to it” by far the best; one of them by far the  
worst.

> 1\) Ask the contact please not to take part in the session, since  
> your relationship is in other areas of life. This is honest  
> and fully respectable.
> 
> 2\) Pretend there is no connection between you and your contact;
> 
> model as though your relationship did not exist. This  
> approach, if it seems to be working, is very likely to change  
> a sense of embarrassment into a feeling of offense which can  
> cloud your regular relationship, as well as inhibit the  
> drawing session. What is more likely to occur is that  
> either of you will quietly change your minds as the session  
> goes on, and straighten things out during breaks, or –  
> better – one or the other of you, recognizing the absurdity  
> of your subterfuge, will break out laughing, thus revealing  
> the situation to the group – in this way enriching all, and  
> moving everything into approach number:
> 
> 3\) Welcome the contact publicly, by name, recognizing that  
> sharing this unexpected mutual interest can enhance the  
> aspects of life which you already share. Your relationship  
> with a group member enriches the group as a whole.

B) Photographers

Photographers should be sure ahead of time that a model expects,  
and allows, photographs. If someone comes to a workshop with a  
camera, and you were not notified of this ahead of time, you should:

> 1\) Ask the photographer to give you the names and addresses of  
> three personal references, whom you will check out before  
> allowing pictures. Work out plans for future photo  
> sessions, if references check out (and do check them out).  
> Don’t let yourself be persuaded to skip this step: too many  
> people have been personally or financially embarrassed by  
> neglecting to attend to it. Use this pamphlet as back-up  
> when you insist on this safety measure; responsible  
> photographers and group leaders will respect your insistence.
> 
> 2\) Show the photographer a model release, and agree to co-sign  
> if references check out and if you are willing to be  
> photographed.
> 
> 3\) Refuse to be photographed unless both conditions 1) and 2)  
> have been met, even if someone at the workshop had been  
> aware that a photographer was to be present, but had  
> neglected to tell you.
> 
> 4\) These suggestions apply when you are posing with clothes as
> 
> well as when you are posing without them. Every other member  
> of a drawing group should also be informed when photographs  
> are to be taken, and should not be photographed without  
> prior permission, and signing of a release similar to the  
> one offered in Appendix D.

C. Societies, Clubs, School Groups, and Scout Troops

Sometimes people wander into a school or museum studio,  
previously unaware that there would be a naked person in the room. It  
is good not to cover up or to leave the pose. The best thing to do –  
recognizing that you belong there and they don’t – is to welcome them  
in, explain what is happening, and invite them to stay awhile, so they  
can get an idea of what is going on. A moderator or artist could take  
the initiative here; the moderator has a special obligation to do so.  
A model – being most uniquely present – is quite likely able to do it  
best. This approach puts things back into perspective, puts the  
drawing group at ease, and provides an amazing amount of consciousness  
raising – often with life-long effect – to children and adults in the  
visiting body.

D. Anything at All

The unexpected is always unprepared for, and “automatic reactions”  
are a matter of course. These reactions are likely to be mistaken  
ones. “On second thought” only comes later, of course. An  
unwelcoming automatic reaction can usually be bridged over by a mild  
apology or a gentle joke, followed by a deliberate welcome – which may  
be, freely, either accepted or refused.

E. Taking Advantage of the Unexpected

Anything unexpected can serve an extremely valuable purpose. It  
reminds us that each experience is – in fact – a new one; it has never  
happened before. Renewal of this “newness of experience” is  
essential; something unexpected jolts us into it, if we have  
forgotten.
