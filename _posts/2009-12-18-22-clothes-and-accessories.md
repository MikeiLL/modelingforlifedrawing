> A) A modelâ€™s clothes provide warmth, comfort, and (for many
> people) a feeling of security, between poses, and provide
> accents during poses. An ankle-length robe can often be
> useful for all these purposes, and can be useful as a rug,
> if the floor is too chilly, or too rough. Bring slippers,
> too: tacks are a constant danger.
>
> B) Large hats, a staff, large or small balls, a scarf, sports
> equipment, a book, or tools can give artists and models
> fresh ideas for poses. It is a good idea to bring one or
> two such items to each session.
