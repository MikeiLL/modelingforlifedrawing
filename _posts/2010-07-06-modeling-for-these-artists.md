A colleague wrote: “I am not sure what would motivate someone to participate in a workshop program based on modeling for art as the theme.” To me, the theme is more accurately described as “modeling for these artists.”   
  
Are these people I want to work with and work for? Do I look forward to  
 the art that we can do together? How much do we consider me as a part  
of the making? Do I want to, and am I allowed to, fulfill my part? My  
part, as a model, is very largely dependent on what you, as an artist,  
want it to be in this work, and on your success in making that happen.
