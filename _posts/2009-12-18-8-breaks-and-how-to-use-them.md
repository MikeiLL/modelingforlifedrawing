A) There should be a short break (about five minutes long),  
every twenty minutes, to help artists and models to  
concentrate properly, to change position, and to get a  
fresh perspective.

B) It is useful to have one long break, during sessions that  
last two hours or longer, for conversation and refreshment.

C) During breaks, it is helpful for models to move around and  
socialize (without clothes, if the situation is sufficiently  
comfortable).

D) If possible, it can be helpful for models to have a look at  
some of the artistsâ€™ work. This enhances interest and  
respect on the part both of models and of artists, and helps  
make the art work more satisfying as a mutual endeavor.
