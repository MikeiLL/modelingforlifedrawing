A) Expect a lot of people, who have worked with you, or have looked forward to working with you, to be very disappointed. B) Expect to miss it yourself; leave yourself reasonably open to occasional modeling in the future, for people you really like. C) Maintain social contacts with models and artists who now work with you; continue making use of opportunities for clothes â€“ optional recreation. D) Keep references to your work as a model in your standard Resume; hold on to your modeling portfolio: for the sake of Memory, personal references for other jobs, mementos for your Family, and lovely pictures of you to look at yourself, and to share with others.
