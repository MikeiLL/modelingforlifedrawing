Since prehistoric times, loving and fighting are the two things that have meant most to people, both in doing them and in remembering. There are why we developed art, poetry, music and drama: to give a lastingness to what means the most in our lives; a lastingness that stays on beyond us, not only for our future but for the future of the world.   
  
This is part of the reason we need to be hopeful. We fight the  
lastingness of what we find wrong; we preserve, and try to increase, the  
 lastingness of what we find right. Loving is the best things we do; it  
 deserves the most preservation and the most celebration; its  
preservation should be part of its celebration, and vice versa. We can  
preserve our love and its celebration, but its permanence is beyond our  
power. Here, hope comes in: so that love, in all its varieties can be  
preserved, and increased, even beyond our powers. We should make sure  
that our art takes its part in this preservation and expansion.
