After you begin to work with an artist, you can usually tell vei  
quickly – often within the first session – whether you wish to work  
there again. Refuse to take part again:

> A) If your rights are not respected.
> 
> B) If the individual or group does not take the session
> 
> seriously (sometimes people are “too busy” with conversatior  
> to concentrate on art work).
> 
> C) If you feel that, for some reason, your professional or  
> personal reputation may suffer through continued  
> association.
> 
> D) If you’d rather not do it, for any reason.
> 
> E) When you are subjected to sexual or other harassment. In a  
> situation of this sort, leave immediately, without waiting  
> for the end of the session, or even for the end of the pose.  
> Send a sharp note with your bill (the bill should be for  
> the full session), and be prepared to report the event to  
> the police, if it is serious. This reporting is your  
> obligation to yourself, and to other models.

Situations like this are very rare, but they can arise. Every  
model should be aware of them, and be prepared for appropriate  
action.
